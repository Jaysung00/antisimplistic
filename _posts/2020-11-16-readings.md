This first installment is unusually long as I wanted to include material going back a few weeks.

## Web Articles

- [How to use Jupyter Notebooks in 2020](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/03/06/jupyter-notebooks-in-2020/): the first of an insightful three-part series on the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem. In it, author [Lj Miranda](https://twitter.com/ljvmiranda921) covers the evolution of methods of practice in the data science landscape, current tools and best practices for notebook-based development workflows, and thoughts on the future. I found the second part particularly useful, with lots of technical detail.
- [How to share Jupyter Notebooks](https://zonca.dev/2020/09/how-to-share-jupyter-notebooks.html): complements the previous article by providing more ways to share JNs including gist, nbviewer, and binder. By [Andrea Zonca](https://twitter.com/andreazonca)
- [Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233): continuing with the Jupyter Notebook theme, this article discusses how "notebooks are the most popular tool for working with data" at Netflix. It describes the workflow, including scheduled runs of parameterized notebooks and collecting code and output into notebooks to create a record of various jobs. It also describes the extensive infrastructure required to support this at scale. At the time of its writing in 2018, the authors were planning to run more than 150,000 notebook-based jobs per day. This is the first of a two-part series. The second, [Scheduling Notebooks at Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6), dives more deeply into the details. Note that two of the original authors, [Matthew Seal](https://twitter.com/codeseal) and [Michelle Ufford](https://twitter.com/MichelleUfford) have since left Netflix to found [noteable.io](https://noteable.io), a "SaaS offering for integrated Jupyter Notebooks".
- [How to improve software engineering skills as a researcher](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/11/15/data-science-swe/): another excellent article by Lj Miranda, which provides a roadmap of skills that begins with version control and culminates in the deployment of a ML service. This is presented in the context of introducing those in academics / research to software engineering fundamentals. It is not a tutorial, but provides a number of such links for each step in the journey, many of which I will likely share in future editions of Worth Reading.
- [Presenting Code Using Jupyter Notebook Slides](https://medium.com/@mjspeck/presenting-code-using-jupyter-notebook-slides-a8a3c3b59d67): I was today years old when I learned that the ability to run slide-based presentations was built into Jupyter Notebook! A very short tutorial on how to do it by [Matthew Speck](https://twitter.com/mjspeck).
- [RStudio 1.4 Preview: Citations](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/11/09/rstudio-1-4-preview-citations/): a close look at the deep support for citations included in the upcoming [RStudio](https://twitter.com/rstudio) v1.4, currently [available as a preview release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). Other features in the update include improved support for Python and a [visual markdown editor](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).
- [Data Science Archetypes](https://e2eml.school/data_science_archetypes.html): part of the [Navigating a Data Science Career](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/navigating-a-data-science-career) unit in [Brandon Rohrer](https://twitter.com/_brohrer_)'s [End-to-End Machine Learning online course](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com)

## Online Education / Tutorials

- [Supervised Machine Learning Case Studies in R](https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.app): an excellent overview of and introduction to supervised learning the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) / [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) way by [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge). A mix of slides and simple interactive code exercises that walk you through 4 different small but comprehensive case studies.
- [Exponential Smoothing](http://uc-r.github.io/ts_exp_smoothing): a great summary of basic smoothing and time series methods, cleanly implemented with modern R methods. This page is part of what appears to be an excellent resource provided by the [University of Cincinnati](https://twitter.com/UC_Rstats), the [UC Business Analytics R Programming guide](http://uc-r.github.io), originally developed by [Bradley Boehmke](https://twitter.com/bradleyboehmke).

## Papers

- [Experimenting with Automatic Video Creation from a Web Page](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/10/experimenting-with-automatic-video.html): an interesting summary of [a paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub49618/) from [Google Research](https://twitter.com/googIeresearch). As the title suggests, they have developed a method to automatically convert static web pages into  short marketing videos, given duration and aspect ratio.
- [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989): provides sensible recommendations for structuring, filling out, and using spreadsheets for storing and organizing data.
