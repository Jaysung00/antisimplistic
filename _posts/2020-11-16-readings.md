This first installment is unusually long as I wanted to include material going back a few weeks.

## Web Articles

- [How to improve software engineering skills as a researcher](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/11/15/data-science-swe/): another excellent article by Lj Miranda, which provides a roadmap of skills that begins with version control and culminates in the deployment of a ML service. This is presented in the context of introducing those in academics / research to software engineering fundamentals. It is not a tutorial, but provides a number of such links for each step in the journey, many of which I will likely share in future editions of Worth Reading.
- [Balanced Accuracy: What and Why?](http://mvpa.blogspot.com/2015/12/balanced-accuracy-what-and-why.html): [Jo Etzel](https://twitter.com/JosetAEtzel) discusses the challenges with interpreting overall classification accuracy (the proportion of examples correctly classified) when the training set is imbalanced, and suggests that balanced accuracy (the average of the proportion corrects of each class individually) may be more useful in those situations. See also the papers related to balanced accuracy, below.
- [The AI Hierarchy of Needs](https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007): summons Maslow to make the point that good data science built on a hierarchy of methods (house of cards?) starting with collection, and moving through storing, exploring, and labeling, before arriving at learning. The success at each level depends on the quality of work in those before. Written by [Monica Rogati](https://twitter.com/mrogati), former VP of Data at Jawbone and Senior Data Scientist at LinkedIn.
- [Data Science Archetypes](https://e2eml.school/data_science_archetypes.html): part of the [Navigating a Data Science Career](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/navigating-a-data-science-career) unit in [Brandon Rohrer](https://twitter.com/_brohrer_)'s [End-to-End Machine Learning online course](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com). In it, Brandon identifies 6 archetypes of people in data science (generalist, detective, oracle, maker, unicorn, and diva) based on their mix of skills in analysis, modeling, engineering, and mechanics. I included this useful perspective in my recent talk on [AI, ML, and Data Science Concepts](https://olearydj.github.io/antisimplistic/presentation/datascience/2020/11/16/dssa-aiml-concepts.html) for the Data Science Society of Auburn.
- [Making Peace with Personal Branding](https://www.fast.ai/2017/12/18/personal-brand/): valuable tips from [Rachel Thomas](https://twitter.com/math_rachel) covering various ways to build a personal brand, including blogging, twitter, and public speaking. Rachel is the co-founder of [`fastai`](https://docs.fast.ai), which I talk a lot about in the first item on this list. I've really enjoyed everything I've read by her, including [this interview on Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/interview-with-the-co-founder-and-researcher-at-fast-ai-dr-rachel-thomas-b00e1702a28a).
- [Could web-based development (game) engines be the end of App Stores?](https://alan-smithson.medium.com/could-web-based-development-game-engines-be-the-end-of-the-app-stores-9a583ae17b14): a quick summary of the history of the app store leading up to recent controversy concerning Apple's app store policies and pricing, including their very public legal battle with Epic Games. Also discusses the "rise of the game engines," and the movement towards web-based tools in this space, including the author, [Alan Smithsonâ€™s](https://twitter.com/AlanSmithson1), own [MetaVRse Engine](https://metavrse.com/). Particularly timely given [this morning's announcement from Apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/?afid=p239%7C10078&cid=aos-us-aff-ir) that, starting January 1, 2021, they are cutting app store fees by 50% (to 15%) for developers / businesses earning less than $1m/yr.

## Online Education / Tutorials

- [Supervised Machine Learning Case Studies in R](https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.app): an excellent overview of and introduction to supervised learning the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) / [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) way by [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge). Formerly a Data Scientist at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), Julia is now a Software Engineer at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) where she maintains tidymodels. A mix of slides and simple interactive code exercises that walk you through 4 different small but comprehensive case studies.
- [Intro to tidymodels with nflfastR](https://cmsac-tidymodels.netlify.app/#1): this slide show from [Tom Mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock), Customer Success Representative in the high tech and sports vertical at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com), is a nice follow-on to his colleague's work on the previous item. Covers an end-to-end case study of tidymodel methods using NFL data in a 90 minute workshop format. Tom also runs the popular [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) R project community.
- [Exponential Smoothing](http://uc-r.github.io/ts_exp_smoothing): a great summary of basic smoothing and time series methods, cleanly implemented with modern R methods. This page is part of what appears to be an excellent resource provided by the [University of Cincinnati](https://twitter.com/UC_Rstats), the [UC Business Analytics R Programming guide](http://uc-r.github.io), originally developed by [Bradley Boehmke](https://twitter.com/bradleyboehmke).

## Papers

- [Experimenting with Automatic Video Creation from a Web Page](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/10/experimenting-with-automatic-video.html): an interesting summary of [a paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub49618/) from [Google Research](https://twitter.com/googIeresearch). As the title suggests, they have developed a method to automatically convert static web pages into  short marketing videos, given duration and aspect ratio.
- [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989): provides sensible recommendations for structuring, filling out, and using spreadsheets for storing and organizing data. Written by [Karl Browman](https://twitter.com/kwbroman) and [Kara Woo](https://twitter.com/kara_woo)
- [PMLB: A Large Benchmark Suite for Machine Learning Evaluation and Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00512): "introduces the Penn Machine Learning Benchmark (PMLB), a publicly available dataset initialized with 165 real-world, simulated, and toy benchmark datasets for evaluating supervised classification methods." A Python interface is provided to facilitate loading and preprocessing the data. A wide range of scikit-learn classifiers were evaluated to assess performance.
