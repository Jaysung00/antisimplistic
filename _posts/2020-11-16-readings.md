- [Exponential Smoothing](http://uc-r.github.io/ts_exp_smoothing): a great summary of basic smoothing and time series methods, cleanly implemented with modern R methods. This page is part of what appears to be an excellent resource provided by the [University of Cincinnati](https://twitter.com/UC_Rstats), the [UC Business Analytics R Programming guide](http://uc-r.github.io), originally developed by [Bradley Boehmke](https://twitter.com/bradleyboehmke).
- [How to use Jupyter Notebooks in 2020](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/03/06/jupyter-notebooks-in-2020/): the first of an insightful three-part series on the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem. In it, author Lj Miranda covers the evolution of methods of practice in the data science landscape, current tools and best practices for notebook-based development workflows, and thoughts on the future. I found the second part particularly useful, with lots of technical detail.
- [Experimenting with Automatic Video Creation from a Web Page](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/10/experimenting-with-automatic-video.html): an interesting summary of [a paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub49618/) from Google Research. As the title suggests, they have developed a method to "automatically convert a web page into a short video, given temporal and visual constraints provided by the content owner."
- [RStudio 1.4 Preview: Citations](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/11/09/rstudio-1-4-preview-citations/): a close look at the deep support for citations included in the upcoming RStudio v1.4, currently [available as a preview release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). Other features in the update include improved support for Python and a [visual markdown editor](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).
