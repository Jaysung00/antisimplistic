## Web Articles

- [How to use Jupyter Notebooks in 2020](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/03/06/jupyter-notebooks-in-2020/): the first of an insightful three-part series on the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem. In it, author [Lj Miranda](https://twitter.com/ljvmiranda921) covers the evolution of methods of practice in the data science landscape, current tools and best practices for notebook-based development workflows, and thoughts on the future. I found the second part particularly useful, with lots of technical detail.
- [How to share Jupyter Notebooks](https://zonca.dev/2020/09/how-to-share-jupyter-notebooks.html): complements the previous article by providing more ways to share JNs including gist, nbviewer, and binder. By [Andrea Zonca](https://twitter.com/andreazonca)
- [Presenting Code Using Jupyter Notebook Slides](https://medium.com/@mjspeck/presenting-code-using-jupyter-notebook-slides-a8a3c3b59d67): I was today years old when I learned that the ability to run slide-based presentations was built into Jupyter Notebook! A very short tutorial on how to do it by [Matthew Speck](https://twitter.com/mjspeck).
- [RStudio 1.4 Preview: Citations](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/11/09/rstudio-1-4-preview-citations/): a close look at the deep support for citations included in the upcoming [RStudio](https://twitter.com/rstudio) v1.4, currently [available as a preview release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). Other features in the update include improved support for Python and a [visual markdown editor](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).
- [Data Science Archetypes](https://e2eml.school/data_science_archetypes.html): part of the [Navigating a Data Science Career](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/navigating-a-data-science-career) unit in [Brandon Rohrer](https://twitter.com/_brohrer_)'s [End-to-End Machine Learning online course](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com)

## Online Education

- [Supervised Machine Learning Case Studies in R](https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.app): an excellent overview of and introduction to supervised learning the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) / [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) way by [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge). A mix of slides and simple interactive code exercises that walk you through 4 different small but comprehensive case studies.
- [Exponential Smoothing](http://uc-r.github.io/ts_exp_smoothing): a great summary of basic smoothing and time series methods, cleanly implemented with modern R methods. This page is part of what appears to be an excellent resource provided by the [University of Cincinnati](https://twitter.com/UC_Rstats), the [UC Business Analytics R Programming guide](http://uc-r.github.io), originally developed by [Bradley Boehmke](https://twitter.com/bradleyboehmke).

## Papers

- [Experimenting with Automatic Video Creation from a Web Page](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/10/experimenting-with-automatic-video.html): an interesting summary of [a paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub49618/) from [Google Research](https://twitter.com/googIeresearch). As the title suggests, they have developed a method to "automatically convert a web page into a short video, given temporal and visual constraints provided by the content owner."
- [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989): provides sensible recommendations for structuring, filling out, and using spreadsheets for storing and organizing data.
