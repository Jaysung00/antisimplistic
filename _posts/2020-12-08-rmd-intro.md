I recently completed a course that used R for various statistical and machine learning methods. In a separate article I have discussed the course and my semester project, [Text Sentiment Analysis with R](https://bit.ly/asb-7130-acnw-project). Another is coming soon with R Markdown tips and tricks I learned along the way. But first some background is in order...

In this article I'll provide a simple introduction to the R Markdown for the uninitiated. I consider this approach, a form of [_single source publishing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-source_publishing), a vital component of reproducible computational research, and an essential skill. The following short video dramatization of real-life events provides a motivating example that we can all relate to... (Link opens in YouTube)

[![“A Non-Reproducible Workflow” by Ignasi Bartomeus and Francisco Rodríguez-Sánchez]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rmd-nrw-still.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3JldKoA0zw)

The video ends with the glimpse of a better future, a hopeful vision of reproducible workflows powered by source control (git) and R Markdown. It is within reach! The basics are straightforward and the short time it takes to begin using this method will more than pay for itself.

## What is R Markdown?

R Markdown was introduced in 2012 by [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui), who has authored many of the most important packages in this space, including `{knitr}`. In his book, [_R Markdown: The Definitive Guide_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), Xie describes R Markdown as "an authoring framework for data science," in which a single `.Rmd` file is used to "save and execute code, and generate high quality reports" automatically. A very wide range of document types and formats are supported, including documents and presentations in HTML, PDF, Word, Markdown, Powerpoint, LaTeX, and more. Homework assignments, journal articles, full-length books, formal reports, presentations, web pages, and interactive dashboards are just [some of the possibilities he describes](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics-examples.html), with examples of each. To say it is a flexible and dynamic ecosystem is an understatement.

Anyone familiar with R Markdown's Python equivalent, [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), will find the following familiar.

R Markdown files consist of the following elements:

* A metadata header that sets various output options, using the [YAML syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
* Body text that is formatted in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Interspersed code chunks that are set off by three backticks and a curly braced block specifying the language used and setting chunk options

Rmd also allows users to embed code expressions in the prose by enclosing them in single backticks.

A minimal `.Rmd` example is included below. This is based on the [Xie's sample](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html), which I've modified to demonstrate all of the elements mentioned above.

    07 This is a paragraph in an _R Markdown_ document.
    08 Below is a code chunk:
    09
    10 ```{r fit-plot, echo=TRUE}
    11 fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
    12 b   = coef(fit)
    13 plot(cars)
    14 abline(fit)
    15 ```
    16
    17 The slope of the regression is `r round(b[2], digits = 3)`.

Let's take a moment to dissect this.

* Lines 01 through 05 are the YAML header (aka front matter)
* Lines 07 and 08 are the body text with markdown syntax
* Lines 10 through 15 are an R code chunk
  * Here is some more info about that
  * And more
* Line 17 is body text with an in-line R expression.

Rendering this to HTML via the Preview button results in the following:

Code output is controlled by options set in each chunk's header.
