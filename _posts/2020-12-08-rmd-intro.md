I recently completed a course that used R for various statistical and machine learning methods. In separate articles I discussed the course and my semester project, [Text Sentiment Analysis with R](https://bit.ly/asb-7130-acnw-project), and some R Markdown tips and tricks I learned along the way.

Here I'll provide a simple introduction to the R Markdown for the uninitiated. I consider this approach, a form of [_single source publishing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-source_publishing), a vital component of reproducible computational research, and an essential skill.

Not to fret! The basics are straightforward the short time it takes to begin using this method will more than pay for itself.

## What is R Markdown?

R Markdown was introduced in 2012 by [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui), who has authored many of the most important packages in this space, including `{knitr}`. In his book, [_R Markdown: The Definitive Guide_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), Xie describes R Markdown as "an authoring framework for data science," in which a single `.Rmd` file is used to "save and execute code, and generate high quality reports" automatically. A very wide range of document types and formats are supported, including documents and presentations in HTML, PDF, Word, Markdown, Powerpoint, LaTeX, and more. Homework assignments, journal articles, full-length books, formal reports, presentations, web pages, and interactive dashboards are just [some of the possibilities described here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics-examples.html), with examples of each. To say it is a flexible and dynamic ecosystem is an understatement.

Anyone familiar with R Markdown's Python equivalent, [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), will find the following familiar.

R Markdown files consist of the following elements:

* A metadata header that sets various output options, using the [YAML syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
* Body text that is formatted in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Interspersed code chunks that are set off by three backticks and a curly braced block specifying the language used and setting chunk options

Rmd also allows users to embed code expressions in the prose by enclosing them in single backticks.

A minimal `.Rmd` example is included below. This is based on the [Xie's sample](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html), which I've modified to demonstrate all of the elements mentioned above.

    This is a paragraph in an _R Markdown_ document.
    Below is a code chunk:

    ```{r fit-plot, echo=TRUE}
    fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
    b   = coef(fit)
    plot(cars)
    abline(fit)
    ```

    The slope of the regression is `r round(b[2], digits = 3)`.

Rendering this to HTML via the Preview button results in the following:

Text is formatted using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), specifically the [Pandoc flavor](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). Xie [details the syntax here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html).

Code output is controlled by options set in each chunk's header.
