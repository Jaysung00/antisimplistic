I recently completed a course that used R for various statistical and machine learning methods. In a separate article I have discussed the course and my semester project, [Text Sentiment Analysis with R](https://bit.ly/asb-7130-acnw-project). Another is coming soon with R Markdown tips and tricks I learned along the way. But first some background is in order...

## A Case for Reproducible Workflows

In this article I'll provide a simple introduction to the R Markdown for the uninitiated. I consider this approach, a form of [_single source publishing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-source_publishing), a vital component of reproducible computational research, and an essential skill. The following short video dramatization of real-life events provides a motivating example that we can all relate to... (Link opens in YouTube)

The video ends with the glimpse of a better future, a hopeful vision of reproducible workflows powered by source control ([git](https://git-scm.com)) and R Markdown. It is within reach! The tools are built into R Studio and the essentials are easy to grasp and apply. The short time it takes to begin using this method will pay generous dividends ever after.

## What is R Markdown?

R Markdown was introduced in 2012 by [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui), who has authored many of the most important packages in this space, including `{knitr}`. In his book, [_R Markdown: The Definitive Guide_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), Xie describes R Markdown as "an authoring framework for data science," in which a single `.Rmd` file is used to "save and execute code, and generate high quality reports" automatically. A very wide range of document types and formats are supported, including documents and presentations in HTML, PDF, Word, Markdown, Powerpoint, LaTeX, and more. Homework assignments, journal articles, full-length books, formal reports, presentations, web pages, and interactive dashboards are just [some of the possibilities he describes](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics-examples.html), with examples of each. To say it is a flexible and dynamic ecosystem is an understatement.

### R Markdown Syntax

> Anyone that has worked with R Markdown's Python equivalent, [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), will find the following familiar.

R Markdown files consist of the following elements:

* A metadata header that sets various output options, using the [YAML syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
* Body text that is formatted in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Interspersed code chunks that are set off by three backticks and a curly braced block specifying the language used and setting chunk options

R Markdown also allows users to embed code expressions in the prose by enclosing them in single backticks.

### Sample Code and Output

A minimal `.Rmd` example is included below. This is based on the [Xie's sample](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html), which I've modified to demonstrate all of the elements mentioned above.

    02| title: "Hello R Markdown"
    03| author: "Awesome Me"
    04| output: html_document
    05| ---
    06|
    07| This is a paragraph in an _R Markdown_ document.
    08| Below is a code chunk:
    09|
    10| ```{r fit-plot, echo=TRUE}
    11| fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
    12| b   = coef(fit)
    13| plot(cars)
    14| abline(fit)
    15| ```
    16|
    17| The slope of the regression is `r round(b[2], digits = 3)`.

Let's take a moment to walk through this, line by line.

* Lines 01 through 05 are the YAML header (aka frontmatter), delimited above and below by lines containing three dashes. Here, we've specified the document's title and author, which are used to generate a header in the rendered output. Other options like date and subtitle are also available. Also specified is the default output type, `html_document`. This section is actually optional, though rarely omitted. When it is, documents are rendered to HTML. More on YAML after the more pressing matters that follow.
* Lines 07 and 08 are the body text (aka prose or narrative). The bit `_R Markdown_` is an example of Markdown syntax, causing the text enclosed in underbar characters to be rendered in italics. A few quirks aside (e.g. [newlines are considered spaces](http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/rmarkdown/rmarkdown_seminar_flat.html#spacing-and-paragraphs)), the rest of the [Markdown syntax is similarly straightforward](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html), but surprisingly capable.
* Lines 10 through 15 are an R code chunk, delimited by three backticks (```` ``` ````)
  * Line 10 includes `{r fit-plot, echo=TRUE}`, which specifies the language for this code block (R) and the chunk name (fit-plot). It also sets the chunk option `echo=TRUE`, which specifies that both the code result will be included in the rendered output.
  * Lines 11 through 14 are standard R code
  * Line 15 closes the code chunk
* Line 17 is body text with an in-line R expression. This expression will be evaluated when the document is rendered and the result will be  included in the resulting output.

Rendering this to HTML via the Knit / Preview button results in the following:

## Rendering Process

Clicking the Knit button (which sometimes becomes Preview for reasons I do not yet grasp) kicks off the following process:

![Rmd Rendering Process]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rmd-process.png)

> In a nutshell, R Markdown stands on the shoulders of [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on). - [Xie](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

While it is not typically necessary to understand the details of this process it it useful to know that both knitr and Pandoc are involved.

It is, however, *critical* to understand the following:

> Under the hood, RStudio calls the function `rmarkdown::render()` to render the document _in a new R session_. Please note the emphasis here, which often confuses R Markdown users. Rendering an Rmd document in a new R session means that _none of the objects in your current R session (e.g., those you created in your R console) are available to that session_. - [Xie](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/compile.html)

In other words your `.Rmd` must run start to finish, without errors, from a clean environment. If, for example, the code relies on variables created or packages loaded via the console during your interactive session, the Knit will fail.

## More Details

Note that YAML is _sensitive to white space_, which is part of the syntax, and _doesn't allow tabs_. You can mostly learn this as you need it, referring to [this description by Xie](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/output-formats.html), or [the YAML and output related sections of this article](http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/rmarkdown/rmarkdown_seminar_flat.html).

`?rmarkdown::html_document` for details on options

[Pandoc flavor](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown)

Code output is controlled by options set in each chunk's header.

# Conclusion

Markdown and YAML both useful skills, easy to get a handle on, with a few quirks. Learn as you need it.
