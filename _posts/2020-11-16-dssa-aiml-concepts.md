In less than 4 months, with minimal fanfare, the Data Science Society of Auburn has attracted nearly 100 members, including a mix of graduate and undergraduate students pursuing a wide range of degrees. Upon hearing about this new student organization I reached out to the founder, [Jordan Eckert](https://twitter.com/jpeckert), to offer my assistance. I have since been elected as the Director of Career Programming. If you are reading this and are interested in presenting to our students and/or participating in an upcoming career event, I welcome your email at <dan.oleary@auburn.edu>!

Today I presented a talk intended to help students understand the "big picture" of Data Science and connect it to study / career opportunities. It was inspired during a lecture on neural networks, when a classmate asked 'how is this related to AI?' Most classes are so busy with the details that they fail to explain the big picture. I hope this helps close that gap.
