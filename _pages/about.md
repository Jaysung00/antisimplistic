Dan O'Leary is Antisimplistic, a second career PhD student and Graduate Assistant in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering  at Auburn University. After 23 years in the games industry as the co-founder of the independent game development studio [n-Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Space) it was time for a change. My academic and research interests are... broad.

I teach undergraduate courses covering innovation, entrepreneurship, product development and leadership in the [Business-Engingeering-Technology minor](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/twc/bet-program/index.html), and support related initiatives at the [Thomas Walter Center for Technology Management](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/twc/index.html).
