            "content": "Introduction to Fastpages . This site is built with fastpages, a platform for building static Jekyll web blogs from Jupyter Notebooks. Markdown and Word DOCs are also supported. . . From their github page: . fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don’t have to fuss with conversion scripts. A full list of features can be found on GitHub. . Fastpages is built by the team that created the deep learning PyTorch front-end fastai and the Python programming environment nbdev. The team is led by Jeremy Howard, former President and Chief Data Scientist of Kaggle and author of Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD1. . Some resources I found helpful in launching this blog: . The fastpages github page has detailed setup instructions | This video tutorial created by Abdul Majed walks you through the initial setup process | A sample blog page provides a live demonstration of its capabilities | . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote2. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
