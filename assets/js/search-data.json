            "title": "Exploring Jupyter Notebook-Based Research Workflows",
            "content": "Much of my life has been centered around software. In middle school I was writing vertical blank interrupts in assembly language for the 6502 in my Atari 800. In 1994 I co-founded the first of two software development companies that I’ve run ever since. Despite all that, I’ve never considered myself a “software guy.” The traditional pattern of write code, compile, check is… well, hard. And discouraging. I have tremendous respect for folks that have mastered this, and consider myself very fortunate to have employed many great, and a few truly exceptional software engineers. . But for me, there had to be a better way. Upon returning to graduate school for Dan 2.0, I found it. Python and Jupyter Notebooks (JNs). The combination of Python’s interpreted nature and the way that JNs combine code, output, and text provided an approach that was much more natural and welcoming to me. Over time, it allowed me to build enough skill and confidence “hacking away” at data science projects to begin exploring software engineering and carpentry. . To that end, I’ve recently spent a lot of time reading about workflows built around notebooks, especially those that facilitate good software engineering practices, single-source publishing, integration, and deployment. Below I’ve shared some of the most insightful links I encountered in that search, along with short summaries and relevant background information. As my PhD focus transitions from classes to research, my goal is to leverage some of these methods to improve the efficiency, quality, and reproducibility of my work while making it easier to publish in a variety of ways. . nbdev: use Jupyter Notebooks for everything: this article first opened my eyes to very interesting things going on in the JN ecosystem, leading to many of the articles linked below. nbdev is a “highly opinionated” Python programming environment that supports software engineering best practices (automated documentation, package creation, testing, continuous integration, source control, and more) for JNs. nbdev was created by the team that created the deep learning PyTorch front-end fastai and fastpages, which this blog is built with. Not at all coincidentally, fastpages is powered, at least in part, by nbdev. All of this was developed by the article’s author Jeremy Howard, former President and Chief Data Scientist of Kaggle, and Sylvain Gugger, now at Hugging Face. Together, they co-authored Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD. I am working with nbdev and will share my experience in future updates. | How to use Jupyter Notebooks in 2020: the first of an insightful three-part series on the JN ecosystem. In it, author Lj Miranda covers the evolution of methods of practice in the data science landscape, current tools and best practices for notebook-based development workflows, and thoughts on the future. I found the second part particularly useful, with lots of technical detail. | Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix: continuing with the JN theme, this article discusses how “notebooks are the most popular tool for working with data” at Netflix. It describes the workflow, including scheduled runs of parameterized notebooks and collecting code and output into notebooks to create a record of various jobs. It also describes the extensive infrastructure required to support this at scale. At the time of its writing in 2018, the authors were planning to run more than 150,000 notebook-based jobs per day. This is the first of a two-part series. The second, Scheduling Notebooks at Netflix, dives more deeply into the details. Note that two of the original authors, Matthew Seal and Michelle Ufford have since left Netflix to found noteable.io, a “SaaS offering for integrated Jupyter Notebooks”. | How to share Jupyter Notebooks: complements the previous article by providing more ways to share JNs including gist, nbviewer, and binder. By Andrea Zonca | Presenting Code Using Jupyter Notebook Slides: I was today years old when I learned that the ability to run slide-based presentations was built into JNs! A very short tutorial on how to do it by Matthew Speck. | . My focus above is on Jupyter Notebooks, but there are lots of cool things going on in the RStudio world as well, especially related single-source, “one-click” publishing. Many great web-books about/using R have been published from R Notebooks using R markdown and bookdown, including Hadley Wickham’s classic R for Data Science. A list of other examples can be found on the bookdown archive page. . Here are a few relevant and timely R-related links: . RStudio 1.4 Preview: Citations: a close look at the deep support for citations included in the upcoming RStudio v1.4, currently available as a preview release. Other features in the update include improved support for Python and a visual markdown editor. | Single-source publishing for R users: describes a typical process for generating html- and pdf-based books from R Markdown using bookdown and ways to simplify and automate the process. I don’t pretend to understand everything going on here, but know enough to appreciate the author, Maëlle Salmon’s work enough to share and bookmark it! | .",

How to improve software engineering skills as a researcher: another excellent article by Lj Miranda, which provides a roadmap of skills that begins with version control and culminates in the deployment of a ML service. This is presented in the context of introducing those in academics / research to software engineering fundamentals. It is not a tutorial, but provides a number of such links for each step in the journey, many of which I will likely share in future editions of Worth Reading. | Balanced Accuracy: What and Why?: Jo Etzel discusses the challenges with interpreting overall classification accuracy (the proportion of examples correctly classified) when the training set is imbalanced, and suggests that balanced accuracy (the average of the proportion corrects of each class individually) may be more useful in those situations. See also the papers related to balanced accuracy, below. | The AI Hierarchy of Needs: summons Maslow to make the point that good data science built on a hierarchy of methods (house of cards?) starting with collection, and moving through storing, exploring, and labeling, before arriving at learning. The success at each level depends on the quality of work in those before. Written by Monica Rogati, former VP of Data at Jawbone and Senior Data Scientist at LinkedIn. | Data Science Archetypes: part of the Navigating a Data Science Career unit in Brandon Rohrer’s End-to-End Machine Learning online course. In it, Brandon identifies 6 archetypes of people in data science (generalist, detective, oracle, maker, unicorn, and diva) based on their mix of skills in analysis, modeling, engineering, and mechanics. I included this useful perspective in my recent talk on AI, ML, and Data Science Concepts for the Data Science Society of Auburn. | Making Peace with Personal Branding: valuable tips from Rachel Thomas covering various ways to build a personal brand, including blogging, twitter, and public speaking. Rachel is the co-founder of fastai, which I talk a lot about in the first item on this list. I’ve really enjoyed everything I’ve read by her, including this interview on Hacker Noon. | Could web-based development (game) engines be the end of App Stores?: a quick summary of the history of the app store leading up to recent controversy concerning Apple’s app store policies and pricing, including their very public legal battle with Epic Games. Also discusses the “rise of the game engines,” and the movement towards web-based tools in this space, including the author, Alan Smithson’s, own MetaVRse Engine. Particularly timely given this morning’s announcement from Apple that, starting January 1, 2021, they are cutting app store fees by 50% (to 15%) for developers / businesses earning less than $1m/yr. | . Online Education / Tutorials . Supervised Machine Learning Case Studies in R: an excellent overview of and introduction to supervised learning the tidyverse / tidymodels way by Julia Silge. Formerly a Data Scientist at Stack Overflow, Julia is now a Software Engineer at RStudio where she maintains tidymodels. A mix of slides and simple interactive code exercises that walk you through 4 different small but comprehensive case studies. | Intro to tidymodels with nflfastR: this slide show from Tom Mock, Customer Success Representative in the high tech and sports vertical at RStudio, is a nice follow-on to his colleague’s work on the previous item. Covers an end-to-end case study of tidymodel methods using NFL data in a 90 minute workshop format. Tom also runs the popular #TidyTuesday R project community. | Exponential Smoothing: a great summary of basic smoothing and time series methods, cleanly implemented with modern R methods.

Upon hearing about this new student organization I reached out to the founder, Jordan Eckert, to offer my assistance. I have since been elected as the Director of Career Programming. If you are reading this and are interested in presenting to our students and/or participating in an upcoming career event, I welcome your email at dan.oleary@auburn.edu! . Today I presented a talk intended to help students understand the “big picture” of Data Science and connect it to study / career opportunities. It was inspired during a lecture on neural networks, when a classmate asked ‘how is this related to AI?’ Most classes are so busy with the details that they fail to explain the big picture. I hope this helps close that gap. . View / Downloaded on GitHub. .",

This Fall I was given the opportunity to take over those courses as the instructor of record. 26 lectures, 850+ new slides, and more assignments / grading than I’d like to think about later, my inaugural semester for BET 3520 and 3560 is all but over. . To celebrate I thought I’d share the following deck, a version of which was used to do the final exam review for 3520. It condenses over 400 slides worth of material, spanning more than 22 hours of traditional lectures (delivered via zoom, of course, #COVID), into about 70 slides that highlight about 30% of the semester’s total content. .

I’ve spent over 25 years preaching the value of a portfolio site to artists, software engineers, and designers that wanted to join my studio or learn how to get into games or related industries. Now that I’m 6 months into my PhD and planning for career 2.0, it’s past time for me to do the same. This sums up the justification in a single tweet: . The popularity of this tweet makes me laugh, because it&#39;s an illustrative example! I thought about trying to get a screenshot of David&#39;s slide, but just took a terrible phone photo of a webinar and tweeted with the quote. . &mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) July 22, 2018 I recently finished reading Build a Career in Data Science1, which I recommend. It motivated me to start the process of sharing my work. . Introduction to Fastpages . This site is built with fastpages, a platform for building static Jekyll web blogs from Jupyter Notebooks (JNs). Markdown and Word DOCs are also supported. . . From their github page: . fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don’t have to fuss with conversion scripts. A full list of features can be found on GitHub. . Fastpages is built by the team that created the deep learning PyTorch front-end fastai and the Python programming environment nbdev. The team is led by Jeremy Howard, former President and Chief Data Scientist of Kaggle and author of Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD2. . I was first introduced fastpages and nbdev during the recent ACM TechTalk, It’s Time Deep Learning Learned from Software Engineering, presented by Howard and moderated by his collaborator Hamel Husain. . From Introducing Fastpages: . fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts. When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically. The same process occurs when you save Word documents or markdown files into the _word or _posts directory, respectively. . Some resources I found helpful in launching this blog: . The fastpages github page has detailed setup instructions | This video tutorial created by Abdul Majed walks you through the initial setup process | A sample jupyter-based blog page provides a live demonstration of its capabilities | . I was able to get the initial site live quite quickly with little drama, and have found the process of modifying existing content and publishing new material straightforward so far. Before choosing fastpages I considered the following hosting / authoring options: . A general purpose site like Wix | A page on Medium or Substack | Other JN-based tools like Pelican | Finding a way to use JNs in blogdown3 | . I decided that Fastpages was the best way for me to publish JN-based work directly, with professional look and feel, on a site that I control, for free. That’s a pretty great combination. I also like that it supports Markdown (like this page), is part of the larger fast.ai family of products (and philosophy), and is hosted on github. . Finally, if you still need to be convinced of the value of building a portfolio, and what to include in one give the following resources a look: . Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog on David Robinson’s Variance Explained | Data Science Portfolios That Will Get You the Job | Thinking of blogging about Data Science? Here are some tips and possible benefits. | . Many of us need to spend less time consuming, and more time creating. Now you know how and why, so go publish something! . .
