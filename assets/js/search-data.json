            "content": "Introduction to Fastpages . This site is built with fastpages, a platform for building static Jekyll web blogs from Jupyter Notebooks. Markdown and Word DOCs are also supported. . . From their github page: . fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don’t have to fuss with conversion scripts. A full list of features can be found on GitHub. . Fastpages is built by the team that created the deep learning PyTorch front-end fastai and the Python programming environment nbdev. The team is led by Jeremy Howard, former President and Chief Data Scientist of Kaggle and author of Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD1. . I was first introduced fastpages and nbdev during the recent ACM TechTalk, It’s Time Deep Learning Learned from Software Engineering, presented by Howard and moderated by his collaborator Hamel Husain. . From Introducing Fastpages: . fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts. When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically. The same process occurs when you save Word documents or markdown files into the _word or _posts directory, respectively. . Some resources I found helpful in launching this blog: . The fastpages github page has detailed setup instructions | This video tutorial created by Abdul Majed walks you through the initial setup process | A sample jupyter-based blog page provides a live demonstration of its capabilities | . I was able to get the initial site live quite quickly with little drama, and have found the process of modifying existing content and publishing new material straightforward so far. .
