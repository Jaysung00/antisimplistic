            "content": "This first installment is unusually long as I wanted to include material going back a few weeks. . Web Articles . How to use Jupyter Notebooks in 2020: the first of an insightful three-part series on the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem. In it, author Lj Miranda covers the evolution of methods of practice in the data science landscape, current tools and best practices for notebook-based development workflows, and thoughts on the future. I found the second part particularly useful, with lots of technical detail. | How to share Jupyter Notebooks: complements the previous article by providing more ways to share JNs including gist, nbviewer, and binder. By Andrea Zonca | Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix: continuing with the Jupyter Notebook theme, this article discusses how “notebooks are the most popular tool for working with data” at Netflix. It describes the workflow, including scheduled runs of parameterized notebooks and collecting code and output into notebooks to create a record of various jobs. It also describes the extensive infrastructure required to support this at scale. At the time of its writing in 2018, the authors were planning to run more than 150,000 notebook-based jobs per day. This is the first of a two-part series. The second, Scheduling Notebooks at Netflix, dives more deeply into the details. Note that two of the original authors, Matthew Seal and Michelle Ufford have since left Netflix to found noteable.io, a “SaaS offering for integrated Jupyter Notebooks”. | How to improve software engineering skills as a researcher: another excellent article by Lj Miranda, which provides a roadmap of skills that begins with version control and culminates in the deployment of a ML service. This is presented in the context of introducing those in academics / research to software engineering fundamentals. It is not a tutorial, but provides a number of such links for each step in the journey, many of which I will likely share in future editions of Worth Reading. | Presenting Code Using Jupyter Notebook Slides: I was today years old when I learned that the ability to run slide-based presentations was built into Jupyter Notebook! A very short tutorial on how to do it by Matthew Speck. | RStudio 1.4 Preview: Citations: a close look at the deep support for citations included in the upcoming RStudio v1.4, currently available as a preview release. Other features in the update include improved support for Python and a visual markdown editor. | Data Science Archetypes: part of the Navigating a Data Science Career unit in Brandon Rohrer’s End-to-End Machine Learning online course | . Online Education / Tutorials . Supervised Machine Learning Case Studies in R: an excellent overview of and introduction to supervised learning the tidyverse / tidymodels way by Julia Silge. A mix of slides and simple interactive code exercises that walk you through 4 different small but comprehensive case studies. | Exponential Smoothing: a great summary of basic smoothing and time series methods, cleanly implemented with modern R methods. This page is part of what appears to be an excellent resource provided by the University of Cincinnati, the UC Business Analytics R Programming guide, originally developed by Bradley Boehmke. | . Papers . Experimenting with Automatic Video Creation from a Web Page: an interesting summary of a paper from Google Research. As the title suggests, they have developed a method to automatically convert static web pages into short marketing videos, given duration and aspect ratio. | Data Organization in Spreadsheets: provides sensible recommendations for structuring, filling out, and using spreadsheets for storing and organizing data.

            "content": "In less than 4 months, with minimal fanfare, the Data Science Society of Auburn has attracted nearly 100 members, including a mix of graduate and undergraduate students pursuing a wide range of degrees. Upon hearing about this new student organization I reached out to the founder, Jordan Eckert, to offer my assistance. I have since been elected as the Director of Career Programming. If you are reading this and are interested in presenting to our students and/or participating in an upcoming career event, I welcome your email at dan.oleary@auburn.edu! . Today I presented a talk intended to help students understand the “big picture” of Data Science and connect it to study / career opportunities. It was inspired during a lecture on neural networks, when a classmate asked ‘how is this related to AI?’ Most classes are so busy with the details that they fail to explain the big picture. I hope this helps close that gap. . . A higher resolution version of this PDF can be viewed / downloaded on GitHub. .",

            "content": "For the last two years I’ve supported first-year courses in Auburn’s Business-Engineering-Technology (BET) minor as a teaching assistant and occasional lecturer. This Fall I was given the opportunity to take over those courses as the instructor of record. 26 lectures, 850+ new slides, and more assignments / grading than I’d like to think about later, my inaugural semester for BET 3520 and 3560 is all but over. . To celebrate I thought I’d share the following deck, a version of which was used to do the final exam review for 3520. It condenses over 400 slides worth of material, spanning more than 22 hours of traditional lectures (delivered via zoom, of course, #COVID), into about 70 slides that highlight about 30% of the semester’s total content. .

            "title": "Blogging with Fastpages",
            "content": "I may be a hypocrite, but I’m not wrong… . I’ve spent over 25 years preaching the value of a portfolio site to artists, software engineers, and designers that wanted to join my studio or learn how to get into games or related industries. Now that I’m 6 months into my PhD and planning for career 2.0, it’s past time for me to do the same. This sums up the justification in a single tweet: . The popularity of this tweet makes me laugh, because it&#39;s an illustrative example! I thought about trying to get a screenshot of David&#39;s slide, but just took a terrible phone photo of a webinar and tweeted with the quote. . &mdash; Amelia McNamara (@AmeliaMN) July 22, 2018 I recently finished reading Build a Career in Data Science1, which I recommend. It motivated me to start the process of sharing my work. . Introduction to Fastpages . This site is built with fastpages, a platform for building static Jekyll web blogs from Jupyter Notebooks (JNs). Markdown and Word DOCs are also supported. . . From their github page: . fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don’t have to fuss with conversion scripts. A full list of features can be found on GitHub. . Fastpages is built by the team that created the deep learning PyTorch front-end fastai and the Python programming environment nbdev. The team is led by Jeremy Howard, former President and Chief Data Scientist of Kaggle and author of Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD2. . I was first introduced fastpages and nbdev during the recent ACM TechTalk, It’s Time Deep Learning Learned from Software Engineering, presented by Howard and moderated by his collaborator Hamel Husain. . From Introducing Fastpages: . fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts. When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically. The same process occurs when you save Word documents or markdown files into the _word or _posts directory, respectively. . Some resources I found helpful in launching this blog: . The fastpages github page has detailed setup instructions | This video tutorial created by Abdul Majed walks you through the initial setup process | A sample jupyter-based blog page provides a live demonstration of its capabilities | . I was able to get the initial site live quite quickly with little drama, and have found the process of modifying existing content and publishing new material straightforward so far. Before choosing fastpages I considered the following hosting / authoring options: . A general purpose site like Wix | A page on Medium or Substack | Other JN-based tools like Pelican | Finding a way to use JNs in blogdown3 | . I decided that Fastpages was the best way for me to publish JN-based work directly, with professional look and feel, on a site that I control, for free. That’s a pretty great combination. I also like that it supports Markdown (like this page), is part of the larger fast.ai family of products (and philosophy), and is hosted on github. . Finally, if you still need to be convinced of the value of building a portfolio, and what to include in one give the following resources a look: . Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog on David Robinson’s Variance Explained | Data Science Portfolios That Will Get You the Job | Thinking of blogging about Data Science? Here are some tips and possible benefits. | . Many of us need to spend less time consuming, and more time creating. Now you know how and why, so go publish something! . . Robinson, Emily, and Jacqueline Nolis. Build a Career in Data Science. Simon and Schuster, 2020. &#8617; . | Howard, Jeremy, and Sylvain Gugger. Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch. O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2020. &#8617; . | There is a lot of cool stuff going on in R these days and blogdown supports a lot of interesting publishing workflows, but I ultimately decided that it would probably be easier to find a way to publish my R work using fastpages than to publish my Python work with blogdown.
